    "I'm Arinze: a thinker and builder tinkering with AI for education, media, and entertainment. I'm currently spending a lot of time thinking about how AI is shifting how we learn, connect, and create.",
    "While the pursuit of my childhood dreams has rendered me placeless, Aba, Enugu, Mauritius, London, Nairobi, and Palo Alto are places that have become home to me.",
    "Grateful to my mum and my teachers at Dority, ALU, Tsinghua/Schwarzman, and Stanford for nurturing my thirst for character, knowledge, and influence."
