  "bio": [
    "I'm Arinze — a builder, thinker, and occasional writer working at the intersection of AI, education, and entertainment. I believe the best technology feels like play, and the best education feels like discovery.",
    "My work spans product development, curriculum design, and creative direction. I'm drawn to projects that make complex ideas accessible and that treat their audiences with intelligence and warmth.",
    "When I'm not building, you'll find me deep in a book, experimenting with new recipes, or mapping out ideas in one of my many half-filled notebooks."
