    "I'm Arinze: a builder, writer, designer, and ATLA nerd working within the orbit of AI, media, and education. I write a {substack} on adulting in the age of AI and late-stage capitalism as I'm deeply curious about how tech is reshaping how we learn, connect, and create.",
    "While my ambitious gallivanting from Meta to TikTok and everywhere in between has rendered me placeless in some ways, Aba, Enugu, Mauritius, London, Nairobi, and Palo Alto are all home to me.",
    "Whatever my life's work becomes, it is dedicated to my mum, my sister, my friends, and my teachers at Dority, ALU, Tsinghua/Schwarzman, and Stanford who nurtured my character and made my wildest dreams possible."
